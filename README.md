### Dialogue Related Papers

RL for Dialog (NAACL 2022) - BY [****Sergey Levine****](https://twitter.com/svlevine)

* [Context-Aware Language Modeling for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems](https://sea-snell.github.io/CALM_LM_site/)
* [CHAI: A CHatbot AI for Task-Oriented Dialogue with Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://siddharthverma314.github.io/research/chai-acl-2022/)

Seeker and it relevant papers

* [Language Models that Seek for Knowledge: Modular Search & Generation for Dialogue and Prompt Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13224) 
    * It outperforms GPT-3 regarding hallucination, and it is better than Blenderbot 2.0 
    * The paper is partially motivated by [Reason first, then respond: Modular Generation for Knowledge-infused Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05204)and [Blenderbot 2.0](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/blender-bot-2-an-open-source-chatbot-that-builds-long-term-memory-and-searches-the-internet/). Many people may already know that Meta treats the task-oriented dialog (TOD) system [Cairaoke](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/project-cairaoke/) as one essential component of Metaverse, and Cairaoke integrates Blenderbot 2.0 to exhibit empathetic language and personality. In addition,  [Internet-Augmented Dialogue Generation](https://parl.ai/projects/sea/) is the code paper for Blenderbot 2.0, and I personally treat it as one excellent paper of that year. 
    * Deserve to note:
        * It integrates a search engine into the open-domain dialogue generation. The search engine firsts search the Internet to retrieve documents and keep the Top 5. Then a knowledge module to select more relevant knowledge from the retrieved documents. Finally, a response module will consider relevant context and knowledge while generating a response. 
        * The knowledge selection module utilizes the [Fusion-to-decoder](https://github.com/facebookresearch/FiD) (FID) model, initially designed for open-domain question answering. Kurt‚Äôs [EMNLP 2020 paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=k8eeP8EAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=k8eeP8EAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC) further applies the FID model and [RAG](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/)to open-domain chit-chat systems and shows impressive improvements. Note that FID fixes the retrieval model during the training process, while RAG jointly trains the model and the retrieval model. 
        * Open-domain question answering models have shown great potential in open-domain chit-chat systems, and the retrieval-augmented models further improve their performances. Is it possible that we can add or design retrieval-augmented models to the task-oriented dialogue systems? As such the system could keep refresh through searching the Internet. 

* [DAIR: Data Augmented Invariant Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11205)
    * Data augmentation techniques on MultiWOZ and SGD datasets. The techniques are also successfully used in the Cairaoke project. 
* [UniGDD: A Unified Generative Framework for Goal-Oriented Document-Grounded Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07770.pdf)

    * [UniDU: Towards A Unified Generative Dialogue Understanding Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04637.pdf) 
        * It designs a unified generative framework for dialogue understanding task, including dialogue summary (DS), dialogue completion (DC), slot filling (SF), intent detection (ID) and dialogue state tracking (DST). 
        * The task query can be regarded as the task-specific _prompt_, which includes the task definition and domain-related information. 
        * It shows good _few-shot and zero-shot_ performance. 
        * Deserve to note: 
        * In general, this paper uses a similar architecture to [T0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.08207.pdf), [UnifiedSKG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05966) and [PPTOD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14739). All of them have text-to-text pattern and use multi-task learning. They have shown impressive performance on few-shot and zero-shot learning.
        * The intent name of negative sample is ‚Äúnot defined‚Äù, where the input utterances Un are sampled from out-of-domain dialogues. The ratio of negative and positive samples for both DST and ID is set to 2:1. 
        * It is interesting to see whether it will take _a long time to train the model_ and whether _it can only generate pre-defined classes_ rather than random tokens.

### Question Answering 

[Towards Unsupervised Dense Information Retrieval with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09118.pdf)

* It evaluates the models on the [BEIR benchmark](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir), where the benchmark contains 18 retrieval datasets with a focus on diversity. Most datasets do not contain a training set and the focus of the benchmark is *zero-shot* retrieval. 
* It shows SOTA performances on unsupervised learning and few-shot learning. The unsupervised pre-training alone outperforms BERT with intermediate[MS-MARCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09268)fine-tuning. 
* Deserve to note:
    * It explores the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train _unsupervised dense retrievers_, and show that it leads to strong retrieval performance. 
    * The ways to build positive pairs and negative pairs are interesting.
        * Building positive pairs from a single document: (1) Inverse Cloze Task: it uses the tokens of the span as the query and the rest of the tokens as the document (or key); (2) Independent cropping: It samples independently two spans from a document to form a positive pair.
        * Building large set of negative pairs: (1) Negatively pairs within a batch based on [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709). (2) Negative pairs across batches where queries are generated from the elements of the current batch and keys are the elements stored in the queue.  The technique is proposed by [MoCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722).
